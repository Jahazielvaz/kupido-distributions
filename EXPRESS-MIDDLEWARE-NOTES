app.use = This will run middleware on all requests.
  EXAMPLE:
    app.use(body-parser());
    app.use(cookieParser());

    app.get(/, function(req, res){
    res.render(index);
    });

    In this example above, app.get would run body-parser, and cookieParser, because app.use makes it so that it runs that middleware on all routes

function log(req, res, next){
console.log(new Date(), req.method, req.url);
next();
}

  This function above will log out the date, the request method whether thats a get post, etc, and the url that requested it, to the console.

function hello(req, res, next){
res.write('Hello\n' + 'World');
res.end();
next();
}
  The hello function, will write to our browser the words hello world.
  NOTE: In both instances we pass the next() parameter to make sure we move on to the next function in our middleware chain.


WE COULD ALSO JUST PASS IN THESE FUNCTIONS AS PARAMETERS TO A GET REQUEST

app.get('/', log, hello);
